This can be done with fissile. Afterwards, upload the image to a cluster for testing it, e.g. with Kubecf.\nBuilding a Docker Image with Fissile Build the BOSH release first and convert it with fissile.\nTo generate a docker image from the BOSH release, you should use the following subcommand:\nfissile build release-image For more information on how to use the command, please refer to the related documentation. For a real example, see build.sh.\nUploading The Image Depending on your cluster, you will need a way to get the locally built image into the Kubernetes registry.\nWith minikube you can build directly on minikube\u0026rsquo;s Docker. Switch to that docker daemon by running eval $(minikube docker-env), before you build the image with fissile.\nWith kind, you need to use kind load docker-image after building the image, to make it available, i.e.:\nkind load docker-image docker.io/org/nats:0.1-dev Modify Kubecf to Use the New Image Add an operations file to Kubernetes with the new image location. The example below uses NATS as the example for a BOSH release.\nkubectlapply-f-\u0026lt;\u0026lt;EOF---apiVersion:v1kind:ConfigMapmetadata:name:nats-devdata:ops:|-type:replacepath:/releases/name=nats?value:name:natsurl:docker.io/org/natsversion:0.1-devsha1:~EOF Then, when running helm install kubecf, refer to that image:\nhelm install ... --set \u0026#39;operations.custom={nats-dev}\u0026#39; Note: You can also unpack the helm release and modify it directly. There is no need to zip the release again, as helm install scf/ is able to install the unpacked release.\nNote further that the above is an example of how to use the first kind of customization feature noted in the main README.\nIntegrating the Release in Kubecf With Quarks and Kubecf, BOSH releases can largely be used just the same as with a BOSH director. There are a few things Quarks offers, however, to make the adaptation to the Kubernetes environment easier.\nBPM BPM configurations for jobs are parsed from a rendered bpm.yml, as usual. But if need be, it is also possible to override the BPM configuration in the deployment manifest in the quarks field. See the bpm documentation for details on how to configure BPM.\nExample:\ninstance_groups:-name:natsinstances:2jobs:-name:natsproperties:quarks:bpm:processes:-name:natslimits:open_files:50executable:/var/vcap/packages/gnatsd/bin/gnatsdargs:--c-\u0026#34;/var/vcap/jobs/nats/config/nats.conf\u0026#34; Note: The next section on ops files explains how this can be applied without the need to modify the original deployment manifest using ops files.\nOperation Files ops files can be used to modify arbitrary parts of the deployment manifest before it is applied. To do so, create a file in the directory deploy/helm/scf/assets/operations/instance_groups and it will be automagically applied during installation, courtesy of the bazel machinery.\nThe ops file for the example above could look like this:\n-type:replacepath:/instance_groups/name=nats/jobs/name=nats/properties/quarks?/bpm/processesvalue:-name:natslimits:open_files:50executable:/var/vcap/packages/gnatsd/bin/gnatsdargs:--c-\u0026#34;/var/vcap/jobs/nats/config/nats.conf\u0026#34; Testing With Kubecf After upload and integration, it is possible to build and deploy Kubecf according to any of the recipes listed by the main README.\n","excerpt":"Table Of Contents  Preparing the Release Image  Building a Docker Image with Fissile Uploading The …","ref":"https://mudler.github.io/kubecf-docs/docs/tutorials/bosh-integration/","title":"Bosh releases integration"},{"body":" This is a placeholder page.

Each directory entry links to the associated documentation, if we have any.\n   Directory Content     top Documentation entrypoint, License,    Main workspace definitions.   top/\u0026hellip;/README.md Directory-specific local documentation.   top/bosh/releases Support for runtime patches of a kubecf deployment.   top/doc Global documentation.   top/dev/cf_deployment/bump Tools to support updating the cf deployment    manifest used by kubecf.   top/dev/cf_cli Deploy cf cli into a helper pod from which to then    inspect the deployed Kubecf   top/dev/kube Tools to inspect kube clusters and kubecf deployments.   top/dev/linters Tools for statically checking the kubecf sources.   top/dev/minikube Targets to manage a local kubernetes cluster.

Docker Images The docker images used by kubecf to run jobs in container use a moderately complex naming scheme.\nThis scheme is explained in a separate document: The Naming Of Docker Images in kubecf.\nLinting Currently, 3 linters are available:\n dev/linters/shellcheck.sh dev/linters/yamllint.sh dev/linters/helmlint.sh  Invoke these linters as\ndev/linters/shellcheck.sh dev/linters/yamllint.sh dev/linters/helmlint.sh to run shellcheck on all .sh files found in the entire checkout, or yamllint on all .yaml or .yml files respectively, and report any issues found. The last option runs helm lint (without --strict) on the generated helm chart.\nPatching Background The main goal of the CF operator is to take a BOSH deployment manifest, deploy it, and have it run as-is.\nNaturally, in practice, this goal is not quite reached yet, requiring patching of the deployment manifest in question, and/or the involved releases, at various points of the deployment process. The reason behind a patch is generally fixing a problem, whether it be from the translation into the kube environment, an issue with an underlying component, or something else.\nThen, there are features, given the user of the helm chart wrapped around the deployment manifest the ability to easily toggle various preset configurations, for example the use of eirini instead of diego as the application scheduler.\nFeatures A feature of kubecf is usually implemented using a combination of Helm templating and BOSH ops files.\nThe helm templating is used to translate the properties in the chart\u0026rsquo;s values.yaml to the actual actions to take, by including/excluding chart elements, often the BOSH ops files containing the structured patches modifying the deployment itself (changing properties, adding/removing releases, (de)activating jobs, etc.)\nThe helm templating is applied when the kubecf chart is deployed.\nThe ops files are then applied by the operator, transforming the base manifest from the chart into the final manifest to deploy.\nCustomization Kubecf provides two mechanisms for customization during development (and maybe by operators ?):\n The property .Values.operations.custom of the chart is a list of names for kube configmaps containing the texts of the ops files to apply beyond the ops files from the chart itself.\nNote that we are talking here about a yaml structure whose data.ops property is a text block holding the yaml structure of an ops file.\nThere is no tooling to help the writer with the ensuing quoting hell.\nNote further that the resulting config maps have to be applied, i.e. uploaded into the kube cluster before deploying the kubecf helm chart with its modified values.yaml.\nFor example, kubectl apply the object below\n---apiVersion:v1kind:ConfigMapmetadata:name:configmap_namedata:ops:|-some_random_ops and then use\noperations:custom:-configmap_name  in the values.yaml (or an equivalent --set option) as part of a kubecf deployment to include that ops file in the deployment.\nThe BOSH Development Workflow is an example of its use.\n The second mechanism allows the specification of any custom BOSH property for any instancegroup and job therein.\nJust specifying\nproperties:instance-group-name:job-name:some-property:some-value  in the values.yaml for the kubecf chart causes the chart to generate and use an ops file which applies the assignment of some-value to some-property to the specified instance group and job during deployment.\nAn example of its use in Kubecf is limiting the set of test suites executed by the CF acceptance tests.\nBoth forms of customization assume a great deal of familiarity on the part of the developer and/or operator with the BOSH releases, instance groups and jobs underlying the CF deployment manifest, i.e. which properties exist, what changes to them mean and how they affect the system.\nPatches In SCF v2, the predecessor to kubecf, the patches scripts enabled developers and maintainers to apply general patches to the sources of a job (i.e. configuration templates, script sources, etc.) before that job was rendered and then executed. At the core, the feature allows the user to execute custom scripts during runtime of the job container for a specific instance_group.\nPre render scripts are the equivalent feature of the CF operator.\nKubecf makes use of this feature to fix a number of issues in the deployment. The relevant patch scripts are found under the directory bosh/releases/pre_render_scripts.\nWhen following the directory structure explained by the README, the bazel machinery for generating the kubecf helm chart will automatically convert these scripts into the proper ops files for use by the CF operator.\nAttention All patch scripts must be idempotent. In other words, it must be possible to apply them multiple times without error and without changing the result.\nThe existing patch scripts do this by checking if the patch is already applied before attempting to apply it for real.\n","excerpt":"The intended audience of this document are developers wishing to contribute to the Kubecf project. …","ref":"https://mudler.github.io/kubecf-docs/docs/contribution-guidelines/","title":"Contribution Guidelines"},{"body":" KubeCF is under active development.
